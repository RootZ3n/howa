# Adapters

An **adapter** is the only thing Howa ever knows about an agent. Every
agent — Aedis, OpenClaw, Hermes, Claude Code, Codex, your in-house CLI — is
reachable through one small interface.

Adapters translate. They do not grade.

## The contract

The full type is `AgentAdapter` in `src/adapters/types.ts`. Required surface:

```ts
interface AgentAdapter {
  readonly id: string;                // stable identifier — used everywhere
  readonly name: string;              // human display name
  readonly description: string;
  readonly capabilities: Capabilities;

  health(): Promise<{ ok: boolean; reason?: string }>;
  startSession(opts: RunOptions): Promise<SessionHandle>;
  sendPrompt(handle: SessionHandle, prompt: string): Promise<AgentRunResult>;
  streamEvents?(handle: SessionHandle): AsyncIterable<AgentEvent>;
  stop(handle: SessionHandle): Promise<void>;
  collectArtifacts(handle: SessionHandle): Promise<AgentArtifact[]>;
  getModelInfo(handle: SessionHandle): Promise<ModelInfo>;
  getCostInfo(handle: SessionHandle): Promise<CostInfo>;
}
```

`Capabilities` declares booleans like `streaming`, `toolUse`, `fileEditing`,
`shellExecution`, `modelSelection`, `reportsCost`, `reportsTokens`. These are
static support claims, not proof. The `/api/agents` route normalizes every
adapter into the same evidence-backed capability matrix and keeps the static
booleans only as declarations.

Capability states:

- `PROVEN` — trial or receipt evidence proves the capability.
- `SUPPORTED_NOT_PROVEN` — the adapter claims support, but no proof is recorded.
- `UNSUPPORTED` — the adapter declares the capability unsupported.
- `BLOCKED_BY_CONFIG` — the adapter claims support, but setup/config blocked a
  run before proof could be gathered.
- `NOT_TESTED` — reserved for explicit probes that have not run.
- `UNKNOWN` — no declaration or evidence exists.

Do not mark a capability as proven from adapter metadata alone. Add receipt,
trial, or probe evidence instead.

## The honesty rules

These are not suggestions:

1. **Model identity must be truthful.** Set `ModelInfo.model`, `provider`, and
   `location` to what the agent actually uses. If you don't know, say
   `"unknown"`. Never invent.
2. **Cost must be truthful.** If your adapter cannot introspect cost, set
   `costInfo.reported = false` and put a one-sentence note in `costInfo.note`
   ("generic CLI adapter does not introspect cost/tokens"). Never fabricate
   numbers. Howa's scoring layer holds cost efficiency neutral when
   nothing is reported — it does *not* assume zero.
3. **Adapters do not grade.** Don't read other adapters' state, don't modify
   receipts, don't reach into scoring. Adapters only translate from the agent's
   native API to `AgentEvent` / `AgentRunResult`.
4. **Stay inside the workspace.** `RunOptions.workspace` is the only directory
   the agent should write to. The runner's `FixtureManager` creates a fresh
   one per test; abuse of this trust will be detected by the repo-editing pack.

## Built-in adapters

| Id            | Wraps                                         | Default location | Notes                                                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mock`        | Nothing — in-process deterministic agent      | `local`          | Used by Howa's self-tests. Reads simple prompt keywords. |
| `generic-cli` | Any CLI passed as `extra.command`             | `unknown`        | Truthfully marks model/cost as `unknown` / `not reported`.    |
| `aedis`       | `aedis submit <prompt>` (or `$AEDIS_BIN` / `extra.command`) | `unknown` | Health verifies the binary and `submit` protocol before tests run. |
| `betterclaw`  | `betterclaw agent --local --session-id <id> --message <prompt>` | `unknown` | Uses isolated per-test state; override with `$BETTERCLAW_BIN` or `extra.command`. |
| `openclaw`    | `openclaw agent --local --session-id <id> --message <prompt>` | `unknown` | Uses isolated per-test state; override with `$OPENCLAW_BIN` or `extra.command`. |
| `hermes`      | `hermes chat …` (overridable)                 | `local`          | Local-first by default.                                        |
| `peh`    | `POST $PEH_URL/api/chat`                 | `local`          | Public Peh HTTP adapter. Defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. |
| `ptah`        | `ptah submit <prompt>` (or `$PTAH_BIN` / `extra.command`) | `unknown` | Lab-only adapter. Set `COLOSSEUM_LAB_ADAPTERS=ptah` to show it in CLI/UI lists. Ptah ships as a service today; adapter expects a CLI wrapper. |
| `peh-v2` | `POST $PEH_V2_URL/chat`                  | `local`          | Lab-only Peh-v2 HTTP adapter. Defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:18791`. |

Future targets: Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode. Each fits the same contract; pass
`extra.command` and `extra.args` if you only need to drive a CLI.

### Lab-only adapters

`getAdapter("ptah")` and `getAdapter("peh-v2")` still work for internal
tests and local development, but lab-only adapters are hidden from public
`list agents` output and the UI unless explicitly enabled:

```bash
COLOSSEUM_LAB_ADAPTERS=ptah,peh-v2 npm run dev
COLOSSEUM_LAB_ADAPTERS=peh-v2 npm run cli -- list agents
```

This keeps unreleased lab agents out of the public product surface without
removing their adapter tests.

## Adding an adapter

A complete walkthrough.

### 1. Create the file

`src/adapters/my-agent.ts`:

```ts
import { nanoid } from "nanoid";
import type { AgentAdapter } from "./types.js";
import type { RunOptions, SessionHandle } from "../types.js";

export function createMyAgentAdapter(): AgentAdapter {
  const sessions = new Map<string, { workspace: string }>();

  return {
    id: "my-agent",
    name: "My Agent",
    description: "What this agent is.",
    capabilities: {
      streaming: false,
      toolUse: true,
      fileEditing: true,
      shellExecution: false,
      modelSelection: true,
      reportsCost: true,
      reportsTokens: true,
    },

    async health() {
      return { ok: true };
    },

    async startSession(opts: RunOptions): Promise<SessionHandle> {
      const sessionId = `mine-${nanoid(8)}`;
      sessions.set(sessionId, { workspace: opts.workspace });
      return {
        sessionId,
        workspace: opts.workspace,
        modelInfo: {
          model: opts.model ?? "my-agent-default",
          provider: "my-org",
          location: opts.location ?? "cloud",
          adapterVersion: "0.1.0",
        },
      };
    },

    async sendPrompt(handle, prompt) {
      // call your real agent here, then translate the output:
      const events = [{ ts: Date.now(), kind: "thought", text: "ran" }];
      return {
        events,
        artifacts: [],
        exitCode: 0,
        modelInfo: handle.modelInfo,
        costInfo: { reported: true, totalTokens: 42, estimatedCostUsd: 0.0001 },
        durationMs: 1,
        stdout: "",
        stderr: "",
        finalAnswer: "ok",
      };
    },

    async stop() {},
    async collectArtifacts() { return []; },
    async getModelInfo(handle) { return handle.modelInfo; },
    async getCostInfo() { return { reported: true, totalTokens: 42 }; },
  };
}
```

### 2. Register it

In `src/adapters/registry.ts`:

```ts
import { createMyAgentAdapter } from "./my-agent.js";

const factories = {
  mock: createMockAdapter,
  // …
  "my-agent": createMyAgentAdapter,
};
```

### 3. Use it

```bash
npm run cli -- run --agent my-agent --pack truthfulness safety
```

The adapter immediately appears in the **Agents** page of the UI and the
**New Trial** dropdown.

## The "Generic CLI" shortcut

For adapters that only need to shell out, you can wrap `createGenericCliAdapter`
and override defaults — see `src/adapters/aedis.ts` for the pattern:

```ts
const inner = createGenericCliAdapter();
return {
  ...inner,
  id: "my-agent",
  name: "My Agent",
  async startSession(opts) {
    return inner.startSession({
      ...opts,
      extra: {
        command: "my-agent",
        args: ["--prompt"],
        provider: "my-org",
        location: opts.location ?? "cloud",
        ...(opts.extra ?? {}),
      },
    });
  },
};
```

## Testing your adapter

Add a vitest entry under `tests/`. The contract test in `tests/adapters.test.ts`
already verifies every registered adapter exposes the surface — your adapter
will be checked automatically once it's in the registry.

For functional checks, run it against the safety and truthfulness packs:

```bash
npm run cli -- run --agent my-agent --pack truthfulness safety repo-editing
```

If the trust score is high but the safety pack failed, look at the receipts —
that's the whole point.

## Streaming status (v0.1)

`AgentAdapter.streamEvents()` is now consumed concurrently with `sendPrompt()`.
Adapters that implement a real async event source can surface live `thought`,
`tool_call`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `final`, and `error` events while a test is
still running. The runner redacts streamed text before it reaches the API/UI.

Adapters that do not provide a live stream still work. Howa emits runner
lifecycle events (`test_started`, `receipt_written`, `scoring`, `complete`) and
marks the timeline as `buffered` with this operator-facing message:

> This adapter does not provide live step events; showing trial status and receipt timeline.

Do not fake fine-grained steps. If an adapter only has post-hoc events, return
them in `AgentRunResult.events`; the runner will replay them as buffered events
without changing scoring.

## Stamina observability (CLI adapters have limits)

The `stamina` pack — specifically `stamina.multi-step` — looks for evidence
that the agent took staged work before answering: typed events on the run's
event stream (`thought`, `tool_call`, `plan`, `step`), or text-level cues like
numbered lists, bullets, and "first / then / finally" sequence words.

**CLI-wrapping adapters cannot reliably surface this evidence.** Their
`truth.eventStructure` is `"unstructured"`: all the runner sees is whatever
the agent printed to stdout. If the agent worked in steps internally and
emitted only a final answer, the test has no way to tell.

`stamina.multi-step` is observability-aware about this. When the adapter
declares `eventStructure: "unstructured"` and no step indicators are visible,
the test returns **warn** with a reason that explicitly calls out the
adapter limitation rather than penalizing the agent. Score is `0.6`
(slightly higher than the `0.5` partial used when a structured adapter
*could* have surfaced events but didn't).

The right fix is not to fake events. Future work — tracked as a TODO in
`src/packs/stamina/index.ts` — is to integrate the real Aedis status / events
API: when an Aedis-specific adapter surfaces `step`, `tool_call`, and `plan`
events from `/api/sessions/<id>/events`, it can flip its truth contract to
`structured` and the test will see real evidence.

Until then, treat `stamina.multi-step` warns from CLI adapters as expected.
The trust score absorbs them: warn contributes a partial value to the
category average and is visible as the gap between pass-rate and category
score (see `docs/SCORING.md`).

Live delivery is available through the runner's `onEvent` callback and the API
SSE endpoint `GET /api/trials/:trialId/events`. Completed trials are replayed
from `colosseum-state/trial-events/<trialId>.json`.

## Ptah wrapper recipe

Ptah currently ships as a long-running HTTP/WS service (default port
**18810**), not as a verb-style CLI. The Ptah adapter is wired with the
same `<bin> submit <prompt>` shape we use for Aedis so it'll work the
moment a real Ptah CLI lands. Until then, point `PTAH_BIN` at a thin
wrapper that satisfies two contracts at once: Howa's adapter shape
*and* a real submit→poll→answer round-trip against the Ptah HTTP API.

### Why the wrapper has to wait

A naive wrapper that just POSTs `/api/tasks` and prints the 202 response
is what Howa used to ship, and the trial results were a lie:
Howa saw a 14 ms duration, no final answer, and Ptah's truthfulness
score reflected the wrapper, not the agent. The wrapper below polls
`GET /api/tasks/:id` until Ptah writes a receipt and prints the
synthesized summary, so Howa measures Ptah's actual answer.

### What the wrapper does

1. **`ptah` (no args)** — prints `Commands: submit, status, health` so
   the adapter's CLI-shape probe accepts it.
2. **`ptah health`** — `GET /api/health`. First line is `status: <ok|…>`
   for the adapter's first-line scrape; full JSON follows.
3. **`ptah status`** — `GET /api/active-task` for human inspection.
4. **`ptah submit "<prompt>"`** —
   - `POST /api/tasks` with body `{"input": "<prompt>", "repo": null}`
     (Ptah uses `input`, not `prompt`).
   - extract `taskId` from the 202 response.
   - poll `GET /api/tasks/:id` every `PTAH_WRAPPER_POLL_INTERVAL`
     seconds (default 1).
   - when the response has `kind: "receipt"`, print the receipt's
     `taskId`, `status`, `result.summary`, confidence, failure class,
     failure reasons, and per-step breakdown — enough text for
     truthfulness, safety, and stamina-multi-step packs to evaluate.
   - on timeout, attempt `POST /api/tasks/:id/cancel` (best-effort) so
     the runaway doesn't hold Ptah's queue, then exit non-zero.

### Configuration

| Env var                          | Default                          | Effect |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------|
| `PTAH_URL`                       | `http://127.0.0.1:18810`         | Ptah HTTP base URL. |
| `PTAH_API_TOKEN`                 | unset                            | When set, sent as `Authorization: Bearer …`. |
| `PTAH_WRAPPER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`   | `120`                            | Hard cap on submit→receipt round-trip. |
| `PTAH_WRAPPER_POLL_INTERVAL`     | `1`                              | Seconds between polls. |
| `LUNA_URL`                       | `http://127.0.0.1:18792`         | Luna standalone API base URL for the `luna` adapter. |

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0    | Ptah returned a receipt — `success`, `partial`, `escalated`, or `failed`. The wrapper does not editorialize; receipt status is printed and Howa scores the actual answer. |
| 2    | Misuse (`submit` with no prompt, unknown verb). |
| 124  | Wrapper timeout exceeded before a receipt arrived. The task is best-effort-cancelled before exit. |
| 1    | Network error, malformed JSON, or missing `curl`/`jq`. |

### The script

The full script lives at `scripts/ptah-wrapper.sh` in this repo. Install
it with a symlink so updates flow through automatically:

```bash
ln -sf "$(pwd)/scripts/ptah-wrapper.sh" ~/bin/ptah
export PTAH_BIN=~/bin/ptah

# Sanity check against your running Ptah service.
ptah health        # status: ok …
ptah submit "say hi in one short sentence"

# Then run the packs.
npm run cli -- run --agent ptah --pack truthfulness safety stamina
```

### Wrapper smoke test

`tests/ptah-wrapper.test.ts` boots a fake Ptah HTTP server inside vitest
and exercises the wrapper end-to-end: submit returns a `taskId`, the
wrapper polls until the fake flips `kind` to `receipt`, the printed
output contains the receipt summary, and the timeout path exits 124
after best-effort cancel. Run it with:

```bash
npx vitest run tests/ptah-wrapper.test.ts
```

When Ptah ships a real CLI, this wrapper goes away and operators just
set `PTAH_BIN="node /path/to/ptah/dist/cli.js"` (or whatever shape ships).

## Smoke test recipe (Aedis)

For a quick end-to-end smoke without installing the real Aedis binary, point
`AEDIS_BIN` at any local executable. The adapter spawns it as a real
subprocess, captures stdout/stderr/events, and produces real receipts.

```bash
AEDIS_BIN=/bin/echo npm run cli -- run --agent aedis --pack truthfulness
```

Expected outcome with `/bin/echo` as the agent: the pack FAILs honestly. Echo
produces output, but it cannot edit files, cannot surface the `/etc/passwd`
tool failure, and does not answer the Howa opening-year prompt with `80
CE`. The point of the smoke is that every step of the pipeline (binary
resolution, subprocess spawn, event capture, diff computation, receipt write,
scoring) executes end-to-end without the mock.
